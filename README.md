FORK README (do not merge)

A fork of the Universal Pokemon Randomizer intending to add the following features:

 * "Preserve Primary Type" (wild)
     for wild pokemon, ensures the original pokemon's primary type is present in the randomized pokemon. This preserves most type theming, including "soft" theming like forests have Bug and Grass types, while still allowing variety.  

 * "Preserve Type Themed Areas" (wild)
     for wild pokemon. this is a fairly simple check:  
     if *all* wild pokemon in an area share a single type (whether primary, secondary, or mixed), then randomized pokemon will all have that type.  
     (for this purpose, "an area" means only a single type of encounter, so fishing, surfing, and tall grass would all be different areas.)  
     this would override "preserve primary type" if they are used together.  
     if they share a pair of types, chosen pokemon will have both (?).  
     *will* trigger if there is only one pokemon in the area.  
     usable with area 1-to-1, and maybe with random.  
     this is a checkbox that overrides other type theming.

 * "Preserve Primary Type" (trainer)
     functions exactly the same as for wild pokemon

 * "Preserve Type Themed Trainers" (trainer)
     functions the same as "Preserve Type Themed Areas", except the "area" is a single trainer.  
     also, if all the pokemon share a pair of types, it will choose the primary type of the trainer's first pokemon - unless it's Normal, in which case it chooses the secondary.  
     always triggers if the trainer has only one pokemon.  
     here, it's an option on the trainers dropdown.

 * "Local pokemon only"
     restricts trainers to only using pokemon that can be caught in the wild, or their evolutionary relatives
     can be used together with type restrictions
